art_with_text__content: Our graduate painting and drawing programs are intrinsically linked with the premise that each discipline informs the other and ultimately supports the studentâ€™s decision to work in a single medium or a combination of media. The Painting graduate program draws upon contemporary practices and discourse in the field to prepare students for a life in the arts. Students are encouraged to work across disciplines and techniques in order to develop a body of work that reflects their independent investigations in painting. Studio practice is supplemented with art history seminars, visiting artist lectures, summer workshops, and travel study programs to New York City, culminating in a solo M.A. or M.F.A. thesis exhibition.
